         "text":"<b>Mysterious Egyptian Pyramids</b>\n\n When you think of Ancient Egypt, there is one image that probably comes to your mind first: pyramids.\n\n Egypt's pyramids were built nearly 5,000 years ago. They were designed as tombs for their kings called pharaohs. The Ancient Egyptians believed that their pharaohs were all sons of Ra, who was the god of the sun. When a pharaoh died, it was thought that his spirit would join his father Ra and all of the other gods in the afterlife. However, in order for the pharaoh's spirit to rise into the sky, his body had to be kept safe. If the pharaoh's body was damaged, he would not be able to make the journey into the sky. This would anger the other gods, causing them to punish the Egyptian people with diseases or natural disasters. The Egyptians thus carefully preserved the pharaohs' bodies and then sealed them inside of stone coffins known as sarcophagi. The pyramid itself was the final layer of protection. Built out of enormous stones and filled with traps and secret passageways, the pyramids were designed to keep the pharaoh's body in and robbers out. \n \n These robbers were not actually interested in stealing a pharaoh's body. Instead, they were hunting for all of the treasures that were buried alongside of it. Pharaohs were laid to rest with jewelry, furniture, precious metals, jars of expensive spices, fine clothing, pottery, and many other priceless items. According to the Ancient Egyptian religion, the pharaoh would need all of these things in the afterlife. If a grave robber stole the pharaoh's favorite pair of jewel encrusted sandals, for example, then the pharaoh would not be able to wear them in the afterlife. \n\n A pyramid's unique shape was also probably designed to help the pharaoh's spirit reach the afterlife. Most Egyptian pyramids rest on a square base. Each side of the pyramid is a perfect triangle. The sides come together to form a point at the top of the pyramid. Some Egyptologists experts on Ancient Egypt believe that the pyramid's pointed shape was meant to lead the pharaoh's spirit to the sky. Others think that this shape was modeled after something called a Benben stone. The Benben stone, which was pyramid shaped, was found in many Ancient Egyptian temples to Ra, the sun god. Historians believe that the Benben was meant to symbolize the rays of sun as they fell on the earth. Because the pharaoh was thought to be the son of Ra, the pharaoh's tomb was modeled after the pyramid shaped Benben stone. Still others argue that the pyramid was simply the easiest shape to build. Because most of the weight is at the bottom, pyramids can be both very tall and very sturdy. The bigger and sturdier the pyramid was, the more difficult it would be for grave robbers to get inside. \n \n Although we have evidence of over 100 pyramids in Egypt, the three largest ones still standing were built in the city of Giza. The biggest of these three is known as the Great Pyramid. Not only is it the largest pyramid in the world, it is also the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists. Built for Pharaoh Khufu, the Great Pyramid stood over 480 feet tall when it was first built. It was almost as tall as a 40 story building. In fact, the Great Pyramid of Khufu was the tallest building in the world until 1311, when the Lincoln Cathedral was built in England. This means that for over 3800 years, there was no man made structure on Earth taller than the Great Pyramid. Khufu's pyramid is impressive for other reasons as well. Each side of the pyramid is 756 feet long. It is made up of over 2.3 million stones. Each of these stones weighs nearly 3 tons. The entire pyramid weighs over 6.5 million tons. When the Pyramid was first built, it was covered in thousands of pounds of smooth white limestone rock that shone in the sun. \n \n The Ancient Egyptians did not have any modern tools, vehicles, or machines in fact, they did not even have the wheel. So how were the Ancient Egyptians capable of making such a massive building? The answer is ... no one really knows for sure. Some experts believe that the Ancient Egyptians might have used a large ramp. Others think that they used a system of logs and ropes. Some others even believe that the Ancient Egyptians had help from aliens! \n\n While we cannot be certain how the pyramids were built, historians agree on one thing: building the pyramids required thousands of workers. We do not know the exact number of people who worked on the pyramids. Some historians estimate that it took 20,000 workers; others suggest that it took as many as 100,000. Although people once believed that slaves built the pyramids, there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that this is not the case. Archaeologists recently discovered the remains of workers' camps located near the pyramids. Animal bones near these sites suggest that the workers ate a lot of meat something that only reasonably wealthy Egyptians could afford to do. Archaeologists also discovered evidence of family homes, bakeries, and decorative pottery in the camps all things that slaves probably would not have had. These and other discoveries have led Egyptologists to believe that the pyramids were built by skilled Egyptian workers who were paid well for their efforts. \n \n The Egyptian pyramids remain quite mysterious. We do not know exactly who built them or how they were built. Time, thieves, and earthquakes have damaged many of them. Nearly all of the shining limestone rock that once covered the pyramids has been stolen or destroyed. Most of the treasures that once filled the pyramids are long gone. Even though the pyramids are not as magnificent as they once were, they are still a source of fascination. Millions of tourists from around the world come to visit the pyramids every year. Egyptologists also continue to study them, hoping to find answers to some of history's greatest and oldest mysteries.",

	 "text":"Pitcher plants are some of the most beautiful plants in the world. With their bright colors and unique, pitcher-shaped leaves, pitcher plants make an eye-catching addition to your home or garden. Growing pitcher plants is not easy, though. The successful pitcher plant gardener must feed the plant properly and pay strict attention to maintaining the plant's ideal environment, including soil, air, and sunlight conditions. Meeting the pitcher plant's many needs may seem intimidating at first, but with proper care and attention to detail, your own pitcher plants will not only survive, but thrive.\n\n In order to cultivate pitcher plants successfully, it is useful to understand that their unique shape, color, and smell are not simply decorations. Rather, they are functional adaptations that allow the plant to survive in its natural environment. In the wild, pitcher plants typically grow in wet and humid areas with harsh, acidic soil. In order to cope with this environment (which does not provide the plant with adequate nutrition) the pitcher plant has evolved the unusual ability (among plants, at least) to 'eat' insects. The pitcher plant lures insects with its bright colors and unique smell. When a fly or a bee lands on the pitcher plant, it quickly finds that the plant's tubular leaves are coated in slippery goo that prevents the insect from climbing out. After the insect falls into the plant's pitcher, it is digested by enzymes and bacteria, similar to the way that human stomachs digest the things we eat. Because pitcher plants possess these unusual adaptations, they have different needs than the typical houseplant.\n\n Since pitcher plants absorb nutrients in such a unique way, proper care must be taken to ensure they are fed properly. Ideally, a pitcher plant should be placed in an area that is, like its natural environment, rich with insects. Pitcher plants can still be cultivated in environments without insects, however. To do this, you must feed dead insects to the plant by placing them inside its pitcher. If dead insects are not readily available, you may alternatively feed it a very small amount of plant fertilizer heavily diluted in water. This solution should be placed directly in the plant's pitcher rather than in the soil. Since the pitcher plant does not possess the ability to absorb all of the nutrients it needs from the soil, it must be fed regularly through its pitcher for it to survive.\n\n Even though pitcher plants do not get many nutrients from the soil, it is still important that the soil in which you place the plant closely approximates the soil in its natural environment. The acidic soils in which pitcher plants usually grow can be replicated by mixing peat moss and perlite (available at any gardening store), the precise percentage of each ingredient differing slightly among the different species of pitcher plants. Once the proper soil mixture is achieved, it must be kept very wet. Many people grow pitcher plants in terrariums, where the soil can easily be kept moist. If you do put a pitcher plant in a typical drained pot, you should leave the pot in at least one inch of standing water. It is particularly important to keep the plant wet during its growing season, which lasts from May until October. The moisture level of the soil is less important during the plant's dormant period, which usually lasts from late October until March. Following these instructions will help to replicate the wet, acidic soil in which pitcher plants grow naturally.\n\n In addition to proper feeding and soil management, a pitcher plant also requires the right air conditions and appropriate sunlight. Most pitcher plants grow in humid, tropical areas, so they will not prosper in climate-controlled houses, which can make the air too dry. Pitcher plants should also receive at least six hours of direct sunlight per day. Smaller amounts of sunlight can be supplemented with the light from a white fluorescent bulb placed approximately 12 centimeters away from the plant. While you can grow pitcher plants in your home if the environment meets these conditions, the ideal indoor environment for a pitcher plant is a greenhouse. Greenhouses provide the type of warm, humid, sunny environment in which pitcher plants thrive.\n\n Once you master the basic care of your pitcher plant, you can move on to more advanced techniques such as dividing and replanting your plants during the brief window between their dormant period and growth period. Before you start learning new skills, though, take some time to enjoy your plants! Mastering even the basic aspects of the pitcher plant's care can be difficult, but the reward (the unique beauty of a healthy pitcher plant) is substantial.",
